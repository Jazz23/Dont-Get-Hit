# Dont-Get-Hit
Don't get hit by a car simulator on soquel avenue at that sketchy street parking by carbillo.


# Game Goals
[Read in Dramatic Anouncer Voice]
-In a world where sentient cars have staged and and completed a coup against the government and decreed that all biking is illegal. Bikers are neglected everywhere they turn. You, one of the last remaining bikers on earth must navigate your way safely along Soquel as it passes through cabrillo college. Dodge opening doors and reckless drunk drivers and make your way to the finish to get to class on time. Swerve around suicidal children who leap from their parents cars with hopes of commiting insurance fraud upon you. Will you be the first modern day biker to get to class? Or the last one to die trying...

-The goal is to avoid car doors opening and children who might throw themselves out of said open doors. You must also look out for drunk drivers who may temprarily swerve into the bike lane. You can buy upgrades for your bike to increase your chances of surviving like a reer view mirror or a helmet cam to increase your chances of winning in court. If you slow down enough before hitting a door and manage to survive, you can take the person who opened the door to court. If you have a helmet cam the odds of you winning increase from the default 50/50. All these modifications you can buy increase your chances of winning in court by an amount.
